# Indie-Hacking

Indie hacking is a term given to developers who are building and launching products single handedly. They do everything from development to marketing to sales.

I was greatly inspired by Tony Dinh's Indie hacking journey and jumped the wagon in Aug 2022.

I'm currently building #100Ideas a place to brainstrom ideas without a million button clicks
