# About Me

#### Hi 👋🏻, I am Bhavani Ravi

I am a Pythonista, Software Engineer, Trainer, Content Creator, and Artist. I'm also taking up a new avatar as an Indie-Hacker this 2022.&#x20;

### Technically Me.

  * Deploying web apps in **AWS/GCP**
  * Deploying and scaling apps in Docker/Kubernetes infrastructure
  * Converting ML models into deployable ML systems

### Non-Technically Me

* I dabble with Watercolors and acrylic paints on my weekends
* I have developed some love for travel recently
* I'm a slow thinker, I need time to process things, which is why I suck at ad-hoc meetings/interviews
