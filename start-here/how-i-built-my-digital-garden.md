# How I built my Digital Garden

Consider this more of a public digital garden. For an entry to enter this private place, it has to stay in my second brain(note-taking system) long enough for me to write 200-300 words about it.

I used to be blogging heavily. But blogs have a date, and it pretty much ends with hitting the publish button. But the digital garden keeps growing and expanding

Here is how the process looks

* I use Google keep to quickly jot down ideas and thoughts. I use it as a pocket diary.
* Every other week I go through these notes and enter them into logseq.
* Logseq is like Roam ,but it's free and has Github integration
* Logseq lets you link your new knowledge with old knowledge, and that's exactly what happens when I move my notes
* The graph you see below is all my private notes. Each dot is a page with a new concept, connected
* Once I brewed an idea long enough in logseq, it moves here, the public digital garden for the showcase.
* Think of this space as a museum with carefully curated thoughts

**It's not perfect**

* Note that this space is not meant to be perfect
* All the notes here are updated constantly

Using gitbook to present my knowledge was heavily influenced by [Bupesh's TIL project.](https://til.bhupesh.me/)
