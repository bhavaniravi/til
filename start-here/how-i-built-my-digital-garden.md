# How I built my Digital Garden

Consider this more of a public digital garden. For a entry to enter this private place it has to stay in my second brain(note taking system) long enough for me to write 200-300 words about it.

Here is how the process looks

* I use Google keep to quickly jot down ideas and thoughts. I use it as a pocket dirary
* Every other week I go through these notes and enter them into logseq
* Logseq is like Roam but it's free and has github integration
* Logseq let's you link your new knowledge with old knowledge and that's exactly what happens when I move my notes
* The graph you see below is all my private notes, each dot is a page with a new concept, connected to each other
* Once I brewed an idea long enough in logseq it moves here, the public digital garden for showcase.
* Think of this space as a museum with carefully curated thoughts

**It's not perfect**

* Note that this space is not meant to be perfect
* All the notes here are updated constantly
