In addition to offering instructions on interpretation, accepted meanings, and representation, it describes the meanings and purposes of data elements within the framework of a project. A data dictionary also provides information about data elements. The scope, properties, and guidelines for using and applying data elements can all be defined with the help of the metadata in a data dictionary.
