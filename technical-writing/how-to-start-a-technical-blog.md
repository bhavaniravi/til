# How to Start a Technical Blog?

1. Pick a platform. It should be the easiet to start. Dev.to or Hashnode are the best options. Medium is also ok but I will stay away from it for a technical blog. I will tell you why later
2. Create an account on that platform. It is a good idea to have your own domain mapped to it.
3. Open any text editor and make a list of all the topic you are comfortable with
4. Pick one, when did you 1st learn about that topic? write that down
5. What are the 3 things that you wish someone told you when starting that topic?
6. There we go! We have 3 sections for your 1st blog
7. _3 things I wished someone told me when learning_ \_\_\_ - That's your title
8. For each of the 3 sections write 5 points.
9. Re-read it, add images illustrations whatever you need to support the content
10. Hit publish. Don't over think
