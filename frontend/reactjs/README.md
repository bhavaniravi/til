# ReactJS

I am primarily a backend developer who hated Frontend(mostly because of CSS) for a long time. It was ReactJS that made it less scary.&#x20;

I learned React primarily from two places

1. React Documentation
2. By building a Todo app

Both of these resources have now become outdated(Curse of Javascript). I'm still in the hunt for finding a good resource to learn ReactJS
