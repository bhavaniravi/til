# How do you do so many things at the same time?

I have also contributed to this problem. From the outside, it might look as if I am

- Reading
- Blogging
- Coding
- Public Speaking
- Personal branding
- Networking

As a newbie, spend most of your time getting good at your craft. It's not a race. Learn things at your own pace. Share your progress in a medium you are comfortable with.

- 10 line blog is ok
- 15 line LinkedIn post is ok
- A page on a google doc is ok

- 2012 - 2017 - Coding
- 2017 - 2018 - Coding + Tweeting

When my friends traveled 3 hours to college, my house was 20 mins away. All the hours I saved traveling I spent on coding after college. I live with my parents, who take care of themselves which is a huge previlege

You might have things to take care of in life, prioritize.
