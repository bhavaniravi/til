# Why We need a Low Key Version of Gratitude Journaling

I went through a serious phase of burnout and depression. As a way to self-help myself before seeking professional help I tried or tried doing gratitude journaling for about 3 months. I decided it wasn't for me, here's why?

* I had nothing to feel gratitude for
* It was hard to find things to that truly made me feel grateful
* When I tried my best, it felt like I'm self-gaslighting myself

To give some context all of this happened when I we were in the middle of CoVID. One gratefulness log might look something like this

> I'm greatful that I have a job midist pandemic

But that wasn't one bit true. I wasn't greatful. I hated logging into work. Every zoom invite gave me anxiety&#x20;
