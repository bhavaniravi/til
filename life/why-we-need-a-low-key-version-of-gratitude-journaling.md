# Project GoodVibes - A low-Key Gratitude Journaling

I went through a severe phase of burnout and depression. As a way to self-help myself before seeking professional help, I tried or tried doing gratitude journaling for about three months. I decided it wasn't for me. Here's why?

- I had nothing to feel gratitude for
- It was hard to find things that genuinely made me feel grateful
- When I tried my best, it felt like I was self-gaslighting myself

To give some context, all of this happened when we were in the middle of CoVID. One gratefulness log might look something like this

> I'm greatful that I have a job midist pandemic

But that wasn't one bit true. I wasn't grateful. I hated logging into work. Every zoom invite gave me anxiety. But I kept writing down things I (was)wasn't grateful for. I didn't see any changes. Infact it added to my frustration of "_having everything but not being able to enjoy it or cherish it fully."_

At one point, it became unbearable. I asked my therapist

> At what point does "gratefulness journaling" becomes "self gaslighting"?

It was true. A technique that is preached to bring magic to your life felt more like self-inflicted gaslighting. When reality was hurting me, I was made to feel grateful for it. So I did what my therapist suggested. I stopped.

Later as I recovered and felt better, I gave it another go. Still not convinced.

Pretty soon, I realized gratefulness for me is reserved for big things and big moments. For eg.,

- Finding my mentor and getting guidance from him
- Having reasonable parents
- Finding an amazing therapist
- Being friends with a few of my friends

Then a thought struck. The whole idea of gratefulness journaling is to capture moments that are good in the midst of all the chaos. So why not do just that? and enters **Project GoodVibes**.

### Project GoodVibes

Our life will have a tonne of tiny good moments. Lowering the bar from grateful to Good helped me capture these tiny moments. The best part, there was no pressure to feel grateful for them.

I have a separate Goodvibes document where I capture these teeny tiny moments I want to cherish, along with a date and time.

Here are a few shareable pieces from my Goodvibes journal

- When that friend gave me a big smile seeing me after months
- When that coworker got on a zoom call to help me through the issue
- When that friend cut through the crowd rushed towards me, seeing me after months
- When that friend paid a special visit to Chennai just to meet me
- When that restaurant staff packed our lunch with the utmost care, which turned out to be the most delicious meal

You get the idea. As I collected more and more of these, I can see gratefulness as a side effect rather than a self-inflicted necessity.

If you are doing gratefulness journaling and it works for you, Great. Continue

If not, give Goodvibes journaling a try.
