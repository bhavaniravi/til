# How to Fast-track Your Learning?

### Know your Why!

The process of learning becomes easy when you're walking towards a goal. The goal doesn't always have to be monetary, it can be your curiosity, because a friend suggested, because of the community you are in, peer-pressure.

You should be inherently motivated to do this thing and come back to it

### Find a Mentor

- Yes, having a mentor who guides you every step of the way would be amazing
- But, you can also follow the work of great people in your domain

### Learning is a Journey

- That never ends
- If you can't figure it out today, you will tomorrow
- Showing up and trying = Learning

### Know how your brain works

- Spaced repetition
- Learning in iteration
- Working at the edge of your comfort zone

### Practice Everyday

- Do not discard things that are there already
- Do things for the fun of it

### Get out of your Comfort zone

- You do the work
- You do the job
- Life becomes repetitive
- Have a constant system that lets you move out of your comfort zone

### Stay away from negative

- There is a difference between constructive criticism and outright demotivation
- It is important to understand the difference between these two
- The way to do it is by getting as specific as possible
- If someone says, "It won't work out" ask them "why" and continue until either you get sold, or they change their mind

### Anyone can do this

Yes, it's that easy. But Staying consistent. That's the hard part.
