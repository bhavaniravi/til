Teams adopting Airflow spend the most time setting up their Dev and production infrastructure, figuring out how to design and implement their tasks.

With the starter package, I will&#x20;

* Set up the infrastructure in your environment. Docker/Kubernetes/VPC, you can decide.
* Train your team to get up to speed quickly on Airflow concepts&#x20;
* Design your initial pipelines by following best practices&#x20;
* Support to fast-track your development -> Deployment process with Airflow
