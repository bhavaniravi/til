# Apache Airflow Starter Pack

Airflow has a steep learning curve. Teams adopting Airflow spend about [<mark style="background-color:red;">3 months</mark>](https://airflow.apache.org/use-cases/onefootball/#what-are-the-results) setting up their Dev and production infrastructure and figuring out how to design and implement their pipelines.

With the starter package, I will&#x20;

* Set up the infrastructure in your environment. Docker/Kubernetes/VPC, you can decide.
* Train your team to get up to speed on Airflow concepts, infrastructure, and design patterns.
* Design your initial pipelines by following best practices&#x20;
* Support to fast-track your development -> Deployment process with Airflow

The starter pack comes with pre-defined infrastructure spec with terraform and scripts to get your Airflow environment up and running, saving you time and effort; it will also increase the efficiency and reliability of your workflow tasks.&#x20;
