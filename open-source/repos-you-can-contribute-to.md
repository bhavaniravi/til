# Repos You Can Contribute To

People often ask me which repo should they contribute to. My answer always is to find a project that you are already using and famialize yourself with the codebase. Once you get confidence that you can add features to any new codebase use this list of projects

These are some projects I come across and want to see more contributions to. Some of them might be abandoded or not maintained in a long time, I see them as great opportunities to rescue and become a full opensource person
