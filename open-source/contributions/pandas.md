Python Pandas is my first ever open-source code contribution. It all started when I was working on Reporting Module for Kissflow. I was asked to run a feasibility check on required features and it's support in Pandas vs MongoDB. Though we didn't end up using Pandas, I had a lot of scope to contribute to the library
