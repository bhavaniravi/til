# When to Use Flask vs Django?

### Use Flask When

* Your project is simple and needs a bunch of customization
* You want to build microservices
* When you want to work with NoSQL databases
* Although there are general guidelines, the structure of the project purely depends on the developer
* Flask is fairly easy to learn

### Use Django When

* Your project involves a bunch of CRUD operations
* I wouldn't recommend Django for microservices, it's an overkill
* Django is meant for working with relational databases
* Django is great for internal facing&#x20;
* Django has strong bounds around how to struture your project
* Django has a steep learning curve
* Django provides tooling for authentication, email, messaging etc., out of the box
