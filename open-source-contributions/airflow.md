title: Apache Airflow - Data Orchestrator
---

I have started using Apache Airflow in 2020 as a part of [Smart Data Query](/projects/smart-data-query/) project. It is amazing tool for building distributed data pipelines. It's seamless integration and working with Kubernetes and Docker is what made it the tool of choice. I started created [tutorials and guides for it](/talks/distributed-data-pipelines-in-python/).

By constantly engaging in their slack community I got a first hard look at some of the common issues, hence leading to some of the contributions.
