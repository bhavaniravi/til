After 2018, I have recently started working on Django for a few projects. One of them came up as a result of hosting my [PythonToProject Bootcamp](https://bhavaniravi.gumroad.com/l/LaFSj) in Gumroad. 

To authenticate Gumroad users into my application I had to extend Django-Allauth to support Gumroad APIs. Once I had the extended version I contributed the same back to the original repository.
